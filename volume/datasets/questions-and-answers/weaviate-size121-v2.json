      "alternativeQuestions": ["I am looking for best practices on designing a schema. For example how would a book be structured in a schema, as a whoole in one property or by chapters or by paragraphs?"],
      "answer": "\n        \n    <p>As a rule of thumb, the smaller the units, the more accurate the search will be. Two objects of e.g. a sentence would most likely contain more information in their vector embedding than a common vector (which is essentially just the mean of sentences). At the same time more objects leads to a higher import time and (since each vector also makes up some data) more space. (E.g. when using transformers, a single vector is 768xfloat32 = 3KB. This can easily make a difference if you have millions, etc.) of vectors. As a rule of thumb, the more vectors you have the more memory you’re going to need. So, basically, it’s a set of tradeoffs. Personally we’ve had great success with using paragraphs as individual units, as there’s little benefit in going even more granular, but it’s still much more precise than whole chapters, etc. You can use cross-references to link e.g. chapters to paragraphs. Note that resolving a cross-references takes a slight performance penalty. Essentially resolving A1-&gt;B1 is the same cost as looking up both A1 and B1 indvidually. This cost however, will probably only matter at really large scale.</p>\n        \n    <div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">One option with Weaviate could be the following:</div>\n        \n    <ol class=\"p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__ordered\" data-border=\"0\" data-indent=\"0\" data-stringify-type=\"ordered-list\">\n              \n        <li data-stringify-border=\"0\" data-stringify-indent=\"0\">Vectorize a summary or title + introduction</li>\n              \n        <li data-stringify-border=\"0\" data-stringify-indent=\"0\">Include the full text of a document (length limited to some sane number) in a text field.

      "answer": "\n\nHorizontal Scalability is currently under development with an ETA for end of Q3 in 2021. Once it’s in it will not share filesystems, but each node will be truly independent with their own filesystem. The partitioning and replication strategies are modelled after Cassandra and Elasticsearch (Cassandra with regards to the virtual nodes in a ring, ES with regards to shards, because we need explicit shards for searching, whereas cassandra would only support direct access by (primary and partitioning) key. Until then Weaviate is currently confined to a single node. If you were to try to run two processes trying to access the same classes, I think it would fail, as each process would try to obtain a lock on the same files.\n\nWe have recently implemented a LSM tree based approached to storage in Weaviate v1.5: Object and Index storage is no longer done using a B+Tree approach (bolb/bbolt), but uses a custom LSM tree approach. This speeds up imports by over 100% depending on the use case.\n\n"

But resolving references in queries takes some of the performance.\n\n1. If your ultimate goal is performance, references probably don’t add any value, as resolving them adds a cost.\n2. If your goal is represent complex relationships between your data items, they can help a lot. You can resolve references in a single query, so if you have classes with multiple links, it could definitely be helpful to resolve some of those connections in a single query. On the other hand, if you have a single (bi-directional) reference in your data, you could also just denormalize the links (e.g. with an ID field) and resolve them during search. \n\n"

      "alternativeQuestions": ["In a two-phase pipeline how many IDs can there be for filtered vector search? how is performance affected when querying?"],
      "answer": "\n\nEssentially the list ids uses the internal doc id which is a `uint64` or 8 bytes per ID. The list can grow as long as you have memory available. So for example with 2GB of free memory, it could hold 250M ids, with 20GB it could hold 2.5B ids, etc.\n\nPerformance wise there are two things to consider:\n1. Building the lookup list\n2. Filtering the results when vector searching\n\nBuilding the list is a typical inverted index look up, so depending on the operator this is just a single read on == (or a set of range reads, e.g. for &gt;7, we'd read the value rows from 7 to infinity). This process is pretty efficient, similar to how the same thing would happen in a traditional search engine, such as elasticsearch\n\nPerforming the filtering during the vector search depends on whether the filter is very restrictive or very loose. In the case you mentioned where a lot of IDs are included, it will be very efficient. Because the equivalent of an unfiltered search would be the one where your ID list contains all possible IDs. So the HNSW index would behave normally. There is however, a small penalty whenever a list is present: We need to check if the current ID is contained an the allow-list. This is essentially a hashmap lookup, so it should be O(1) per object. Nevertheless, there is a slight performance penalty.\n\nNow the other extreme, a very restrictive list, i.e few IDs on the list, actually takes considerably more time. Because the HNSW index will find neighboring IDs, but since they're not contained, they cannot be added as result candidates, meaning that all we can do with them is evaluating their connections, but not the points themselves. In the extreme case of a list that is very, very restrictive, say just 10 objects out of 1B in the worst case the search would become exhaustive if you the filtered ids are very far from the query. In this extreme case, it would actually be much more efficient to just skip the index and do a brute-force indexless vector search on the 10 ids. So, there is a cut-off when a brute-force search becomes more efficient than a heavily-restricted vector search with HNSW. We do not yet have any optimization to discovery such a cut-off point and skip the index, but this should be fairly simple to implement if this ever becomes an actual problem.\n\n"

      "question": "What would you say is more important for query speed in Weaviate: More CPU power, or more RAM?",
      "alternativeQuestions": ["For query speed, what is more important, CPU power or RAM?"],
      "answer": "\n\nMore concretely: If you had to pick between a machine that has 16 GB of RAM and 2 CPUs, or a machine that has 8 GB of RAM and 4 CPUs, which would you pick?\n\nThis is a very difficult to answer 100% correctly, because there are several factors in play:\n* **The vector search itself**. This part is CPU-bound, however only with regards to throughput: A single search is single-threaded. Multiple parallel searches can use multiple threads. So if you measure the time of a single request (otherwise idle), it will be the same whether the machine has 1 core or 100. However, if your QPS approach the throughput of a CPU, you'll see massive benefits by adding more Cores\n* **The retrieval of the objects**. Once the vector search part is done, we are essentially left with a list of n IDs which need to be resolved to actual objects. This is IO-bound in general. However, all disk files are memory-mapped. So generally, more mem will allow you to hold more of the disk state in memory. In real life however, it's not that simple. Searches are rarely evenly distributed. So let's pretend that 90% of searches will return just 10% of objects (because these are more popular search results). Then if those 10% of the disk objects are already cached in mem, there's no benefit in adding more memory.\n\nTaking the above in mind: we can carefully say: If throughput is the problem, increase CPU, if response time is the problem increase mem. However, note that the latter only adds value if there are more things that can be cached. If you have enough mem to cache your entire disk state (or at least the parts that are relevant for most queries), additional memory won't add any additional benefit.\nIf we are talking about imports on the other hand, they are almost always CPU-bound because of the cost of creating the HNSW index. So, if you can resize between import and query, my recommendation would be roughly prefer CPUs while importing and then gradually replace CPU with memory at query time - until you see no more benefits. (This assumes that there is a separation between importing and querying which might not always be the case in real life).\n\n"

      "alternativeQuestions": ["Using a distributed setup, what consistency model is Weaviate using?"],
      "answer": "\n\nWeaviate is generally modeled to prefer Availability over Consistency (AP over CP). It is designed to deliver low search latencies under high throughput in situations where availability is more business-critical than consistency. If strict serializability is required on your data, we generally recommend storing your data in a different primary data store, use Weaviate as an auxiliary data store, and set up replication between the two. If you do not need serializability and eventual consistency is enough for your use case, Weaviate can be used as a primary datastore.\n\nWeaviate has no notion of transactions, operations always affect exactly a single key, therefore Serializability is not applicable. In a distributed setup (under development) Weaviate's consistency model is eventual consistency. When a cluster is healthy, all changes are replicated to all affected nodes by the time the write is acknowledged by the user. Objects will immediately be present in search results on all nodes after the import request completes. If a search query occurs concurrently with an import operation nodes may not be in sync yet. This means some nodes might already include the newly added or updated objects, while others don't yet. In a healthy cluster, all nodes will have converged by the time the import request has been completed successfully. If a node is temporarily unavailable and rejoins a cluster it may temporarily be out of sync. It will then sync the missed changes from other replica nodes and eventually serve the same data again. \n\n"
